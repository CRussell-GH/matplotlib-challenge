There is a strong correlation of 0.84 between mouse weight and average tumor volume. It would be wise in this experiment to control for mouse weight to avoid bias in the study.

Capomulin and Ramicane are the two most effective drug regimens.  They have by far the lowest mean and median of tumor volume and are the only two drug regimens where these numbers fall under the volume of the initial tumor.

These two drug regimens also have by far the tightest distributions; however this is most likely attributed to the fact that those two drug regimens have by far the most timepoints taken.  This is most likely because less mice die during the experiment on the better drug regimens, so the timepoints taken for the less effective drugs skews right and this causes a larger variance in tumor volume.
